## The 8 Puzzle

This project will code three methods of solving an 8 puzzle problem: Uniform Cost, A* with misplaced tile heuristic and A* with the manhattan distance heuristic. This read me will contain the same contents as the project report, but summarized. This repository will allow me to track my changes in code and progress.
